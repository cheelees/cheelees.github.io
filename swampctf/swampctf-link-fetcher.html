  <h1>SwampCTF's Link Fetcher Write-up</h1>
  <p>
      This is a writeup for SwampCTF's Link Fetcher web challenge.

      Challenge description:
      <div>
        <p>It's the year 1997 and the Internet is just heating up! :fire:

In order to get ahead of the curve, SIT Industries® has introduced it's first Internet product: The Link Saver™. SIT Industries® has been very secretive about this product - even going so far to hire Kernel Sanders® to test the security!

However, The Kernel discovered that The Link Saver had a little bit of an SSRF problem that allowed any user to fetch the code for The Link Saver™ from https://localhost/key and host it themselves :grimacing:. Fortunately, with a lil' parse_url magic, SIT Industries® PHP wizards have patched this finding from Kernel Sanders® and are keeping the code behind this wonderful site secure!

... or have they? :wink:

      </div>
      On our initial visit to the website, we're presented with our information:
      We get an input box to submit URLs which the site will then link to.
      </br>
      <img src = "images/initialvisit.PNG"/>
      </br>
      </br>
      First step, lets take a look at the source code.
      </br>
      <img src = "images/source.PNG" />
      </br>
      Nothing interesting here, just what we see on the page.
    </br>
    </br>
    Judging from the challenge description, this is an <a href="https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/server-side-request-forgery-vulnerability/">SSRF vulnerability</a> which we
    can exploit using the Submit Query function. However, from the challenge
    description it seems using localhost / 127.0.0.1 to try and access
    /localhost/key  will be blocked.
    </br>
    </br>
    <img src = "images/internal1.PNG" />
    <img src = "images/internal2.PNG" />
    </br>
      </br>
    Yep, blocked.
    After doing a bit of googling around, it seems there are a few ways to
    bypass PHP's parse_url function so we can access the key.
  </br>
    </br>
    I managed to locate a presentation put on by "Orange Tsai" at the blackhat
    USA 2017 conference, located <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Tsai-A-New-Era-Of-SSRF-Exploiting-URL-Parser-In-Trending-Programming-Languages.pdf">here</a>
    In particular, I found this slide very useful as it contained what I was
    trying to do - read the /localhost/key file.
  </br>
    </br>
    <img src = "images/slide.png"/>
      </br>
  </br>
    Following this logic, we could use the parse_url function to parse an
    arbitrary site, in this case google.com, but abuse the PHP readfile functionality
    to read our desired file.
      </br>
    </br>
    Adapting the payload for our use, we can get the key.
      </br>
      </br>
    <img src = "images/flag.png"/>
      </br>
    </br>
    <strong>flag: flag{y0u_cANn0t_TRU5t_php}</strong>
  </br>
</br>
    I honestly don't know how using "@" to access a local file works, which is something
    I need to investigate further.
    Hope you enjoyed this write up
