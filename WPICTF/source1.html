  <h1>Write up for Source1 - a Pwn Challenge</h1>

  <strong>Challenge Description:</strong>
</br></br>
  <div style="background-color:cyan">
    ssh source@source.wpictf.xyz -p 31337 (or 31338 or 31339). Password is sourcelocker
  </br>
Here is your babybuff.

  </div>

<p> When we ssh in, it requests a password. After trying to put a random password in,
  it rejects the password and closes the ssh connection.</p>

<p>Seeing as we don't really know what's going on in the back-end, my first thought
is to see if we can overflow the password buffer.
I entered a whole lot of "a"s to see what would happen.

<p> Cool! Seems like we can manage to overflow the buffer and skip some of the operations.
</p>
<p>From here, the next thing I did was still to enter a large number of characters, but slightly less than last time.
</p>
</br>
I entered around 110 "a"s, and suddenly it pops up with the program's source code.

<p> and we get the flag. <strong>WPI{Typos_are_GrEaT!}</strong>
Honestly I have no idea how this works, so this is something I definitely need
to figure out. </p>

</br>
<p> hope you enjoyed.</p>
